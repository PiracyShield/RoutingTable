# PiracyShield Routing Table

Aggregated elaboration of PiracyShield to ensure efficient Routing Performance!

## File Structure

In order to improve Routing Performance and allow Routing on low-end Routers, we provide aggregations of the blocked IPs. 
If a /24 subnet contains more than N IPs (where N is known in N.txt), the whole /24 is used instead of the IPs. If two adjacent /24 are used, they are merged into /23 and so on.

We only provide an elaborations of actual data, real data is not provided here.
